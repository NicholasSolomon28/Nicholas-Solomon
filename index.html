      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>EcoPure was founded in 2017 by <strong>Nick Solomon</strong>, an environmental entrepreneur and student at the University of New Hampshire. What began as a small operation selling biodegradable cleaning products at local markets has since grown into a nationally recognized brand. From reusable kitchenware to compostable packaging, EcoPure has evolved into a full-spectrum sustainable lifestyle company.</p>

      <p>EcoPure stands apart due to our ethical sourcing, dedicated eco-conscious team, and commitment to real environmental change. We offer reusable household goods, organic personal care items, and biodegradable packagingâ€”all made with the environment and community in mind.</p>
